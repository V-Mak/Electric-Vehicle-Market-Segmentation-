# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Segmentation-

Problem Statement:

The Electric Vehicle (EV) industry is at the forefront of sustainable transportation, with vast potential in the Indian market. However, successfully entering this dynamic sector requires a data-driven strategy. As a team under an EV startup, we face the challenge of defining a clear path to enter the Indian EV market, identifying the most promising customer segments, and formulating strategies that resonate with these segments. Our challenge encompasses addressing the lack of readily available geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data, which necessitates extensive research and data collection. This project aims to navigate these challenges and lay the foundation for a successful market entry strategy in the Indian EV market.
